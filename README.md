# CyBot
Open Source Threat Intelligence Chat Bot

Threat intelligence chat bots are useful friends. They perform research for you and can even be note takers or central aggregators of information. However, it seems like most organizations want to design their own bot in isolation and keep it internal. To counter this trend, our goal was to create a repeatable process using a completely free and open source framework, an inexpensive Raspberry Pi (or even virtual machine), and host a community-driven plugin framework to open up the world of threat intel chat bots to everyone from the home user to the largest security operations center.

We are excited to share with the world a chat bot that we affectionately call CyBot. We will show you what CyBot can do for you and graciously accept feedback on future improvements. Best of all, if you know even a little bit of Python, you can help write plugins and share them with the community. If you want to build your own CyBot, the instructions in this project will let you do so with about an hour of invested time and anywhere from $0-$35 in expenses--quite a good return on your investment.
